        <h1>The Beginnerâ€™s Guide to Houseplants</h1>
        <h2>How to grow happy and healthy houseplants</h2>

        <h4>
            If you want your houseplants to thrive there are a few things you should
            keep in mind. It all depends on the type of plant, the location and when
            and how you water it.
        </h4>
        <p>
            <strong>Light and Location</strong><br />
            When you get your plant home, itâ€™s time to consider the spot where the
            plant would most likely thrive. Look at the light options in your home.
            All plants need light to grow, but some need more light than others.<br />
            <br /><strong>When and how to Water your Plant</strong><br />The main
            reason most houseplants donâ€™t thrive is because of overwatering. Too
            much water can harm your plant more than too little water. Donâ€™t just
            water your plant every Saturday because it fits your schedule, the plant
            might not need the water yet. The good rule of thumb is to stick your
            finger into the soil. If the soil is dry, give your plant a good
            watering. If the soil is still moist from the last time, wait few more
            days and then check again.
